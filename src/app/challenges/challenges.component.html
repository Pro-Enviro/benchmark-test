  <p>
    <strong>Biggest challenge was to implement custom rating system</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I tried various ways to implement it based on previous knowledges in React
    but no success. I was researching the Angular documentation and found a way
    to implement it.

    <strong>Personal notes</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice everything is working fine, but I am not sure if my take is the
    best on design and the code(as PrimeNG was there). It's my first time coding
    in Angular besides yesterday(14.01.2024) when I checked the documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    After implementing the ng-container I checked what "PrimeNG" is and... oh
    boy, it was solving the problem with a simple import. I will keep the
    current implementation as a reminder of my first Angular project.

    <strong>Final note:</strong>
    <br />
    It was a good experience and fun to try Angular by doing this project. I
    wanted to contact the person from GitHub (SillyMonkey1925), but probably
    there is no way on Github and I didn't want to disturb the person from
    Indeed(Rian) althrough on GitHub questions were welcomed.
